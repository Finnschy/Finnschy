### Hi there 👋  
My name's Finn and I'm a graphic designer with experience in print but also a frontend developer with experience in building web apps with HTML/ CSS/ SASS, JavaScript, ReactJs, Node/ ExpressJs and Ejs. I'm also teaching HTML, CSS and JS as an assistant trainer at [supercode](super-code.de). 📖

🔭 I’m currently working on the webpage from supercode.

🌱 I’m currently learning ExpressJs and Ejs and mongoDB.

💬 Ask me about my favourite dinosaur!
