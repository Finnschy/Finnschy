My name's Finn and I'm a graphic designer with experience in print but also a frontend developer with experience in building web apps with HTML/ CSS/ SASS, JavaScript, ReactJs, Node/ ExpressJs and Ejs. I'm also teaching HTML, CSS and JS as an assistant trainer at [supercode](https://www.super-code.de/). ðŸ“–
